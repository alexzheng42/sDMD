# The reaction bonds (HB and/or disulfur bonds) have been existing before the simulation.
# 2019/5/16 added bonds between AA and surface (the target atom is fixed)
#
# !!NOTE!! 
# The atom number should be from the .gro file processed by sDMD, instead of from the
# original, since the program may have removed some unimportant atoms from the original
# .gro/.pdb file during processing and changed the sequence number.

# !FORMAT!
# N (the total bond number)

# atom2_1	atom2_2
